	 * <p>
	 * It starts with the lyric "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of
	 * beer.", followed by "Take one down and pass it around, 99 bottles of beer
	 * on the wall." From here, the number decreases and you do it again, until

	 * bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer." and "Go to the
	 * store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The full lyrics would be like:<br>
	 *
	 * 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.<br>
	 * Take one down and pass it around, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
	 * 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.<br>
	 * Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
	 * ...<br>
	 * 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.<br>
	 * Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
	 * 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.<br>
	 * Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.<br>
	 * No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.<br>
	 * Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
